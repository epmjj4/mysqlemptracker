# Description
I created the connection.js file that uses the util and mysql modules. I also created the connection to the database. I then created the server.js file using the inquirer and log modules as well as the path to the db folder. This file contains the functions used by end user to make changes and modifications. The index.js files use a constructor called DB to grab employee info from database as well as created and updated departments, roles, and employees. Then the schema.sql file was created this builds the database and the tables. The seed.sql hold the database info for the departments, roles, and employees.
